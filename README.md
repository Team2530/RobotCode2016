# RobotCode2016
Repository of Robot Code 2016 for First Stronghold

---
This is the code that runs on Team2530's 2016 Robot.

It is designed to have as few dependancies as possible. 

To build, clone the repositry into your Eclipse workspace. 

Then create a branch for your code (in your github command line tool)

```sh
git branch [insert-your-name]
```
Copy the files from RobotCode2016/code/ into your workspace/project/src.

When you are done, copy the files from workspace/project/src back to repository path/code/.

Don't forget to add new files to track

```sh
git add [relative-path-to-filename]
```

Once you have tested your changes, lets get them committed and pushed:

```sh
git commit -m "[Insert-comment-about-update-here]"
git push origin [insert-your-name]
```
