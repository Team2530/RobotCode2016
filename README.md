# RobotCode2016
Repository of Robot Code 2016 for First Stronghold

---
This is the code that runs on Team2530's 2016 Robot.

It is designed to have as few dependancies as possible. 

To build, clone the repositry into your Eclipse workspace. 

Then create a branch for your code (in your github command line tool)

```sh
git branch [insert-your-name]
```

Don't forget to add files to track

```sh
git add [relative-path-to-filename]
```

Once you have tested your changes, lets get them committed and pushed:

```sh
git commit (press i in the editor, type what you changed, then hit ESC. Then type :w :q) [This is what text editors were long before microsoft word or notepad.]
git push origin [insert-your-name]
```
